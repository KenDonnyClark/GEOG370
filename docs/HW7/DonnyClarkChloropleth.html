<h1>Homework 7: New Jersey census data choropleth </h1>
<h2>Ken Donny-Clark</h2>
<h3>This chloropleth shows the levels of foreign language fluency of individuals over 5 years old in the counties of New Jersey. I think this is an interesting variable to display because it can show where foreign cultures are prevelant and where people who have recently immigrated tend to live. As you might see, foriegn language proficiency is generally higher in the northern costal counties. This might be because major cities such a Jersey City and Perth Amboy are on the northern coast, and because that area in general is closer to NYC.  </h3>
